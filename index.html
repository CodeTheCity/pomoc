			<h2>Access to health in your community</h2>
			<p>
				Healthcare is very different in the UK compared to Poland, here's what you need to know:
				<br>
				Have a cold, mild fever, minor aches and pains, or maybe some skin complaints? Your local pharmacist can sell you some remedies for this over the counter without a prescription and give you free advice on your condition.
				<br>
				If you find that your condition requires you to attend your doctor's surgery, the receptionist may ask you some questions about your condition. This is to direct you to the most appropriate person for your condition. This may not be a doctor, but may in stead be a nurse-practitioner, a practice nurse, or other health professional; this is to ensure that everyone can get an appointment suitable to their condition.

			<h3>Why would you go the pharmacy?</h3>
                        <p>
			In Poland you would only go to the pharmacy to get a prescription fulfilled whereas in Scotland there are a greater range of services available.
			<br>
			The pharmacy is an accessible health resource for you and your family. Everyone can get advice from a pharmacist and buy medicine for a minor ailment or illness.
			<br>Many pharmacies are open when your GP surgery is shut (evenings, weekends and on public holidays). You don't even need to make an appointment to speak to a pharmacist.
			<br>A pharmacist provides lots of services and can help if:
			<br>
			<h3>You or a member of your family are suffering from a minor ailment or illness</h3>
			<br>There is a service, available from every pharmacy in Scotland, called the NHS Minor Ailment service.
			<br>Minor ailments or illnesses, which can be treated include:
			<ul>
				<li>Acne, athlete's foot, allergies.</li>
				<li>Backache.</li>
				<li>Coldsores, constipation, coughs.</li>
				<li>Diarrhoea.</li>
				<li>Earache, eczema.</li>
				<li>Haemorrhoids (piles), hay fever, headache, head lice.</li>
				<li>Indigestion.</li>
				<li>Mouth ulcers.</li>
				<li>Nasal congestion.</li>
				<li>Pain, period pain.</li>
				<li>Sore throat, thrush, threadworms.</li>
				<li>Warts and verrucas.</li>
				<li>Colds.</li>
				<li>Eye infections.</li>
				<li>Travel sickness.</li>
				<li>Teething advice.</li>
				<li>Worms.</li>
			</ul>
			Even if you are not eligible for this service the pharmacist will be able to provide you with advice on any of the ailments/illnesses listed above.
			<br>
			If the pharmacist is not able to help, your GP is closed, and they feel they can refer you to an out of hours doctor without you having to call NHS 24.
			<br>
			You can find out more about the NHS Minor Ailment Service on the Scottish Government website.
			<br>
			If you or a member of your family has run out of their regular repeat medication and your GP surgery is closed, and you are registered with a GP in Scotland, any community pharmacist can in certain circumstances under the NHS provide you with a supply of your regular repeat medication. This is at the discretion of the pharmacist and should only be in one off situations.
			<br>
			There are some medicines that the pharmacist is not allowed to supply and this service can not be used to obtain a supply of methadone or any other substitution therapy.
			<br>
			If you are on holiday from another part of the UK, or your regular pharmacy is closed a pharmacist can still make an emergency supply of your usual medicines.
			<br>
			If you are visiting from overseas, or you are not registered with a GP in the UK you need to contact a local surgery. You can find your nearest GP on this site or call NHS inform on 0800 22 44 88 (8am to 10pm, 7 days)
			However, you should remember:
			<ul>
				<li>To make sure you order and collect your repeat prescription in plenty of time so you don’t run out! </li>
				<li>Remember that all GP surgeries are shut from 6pm on Friday night until 8am on Monday morning. GP surgeries are also closed on public holidays. Make sure you find out when your local public holidays are (these vary across Scotland) and when your GP will be open.</li>
				<li>Not to phone NHS 24 if you have run out of your medicine, please call or visit a pharmacy first. You can find your nearest pharmacy on this site, or call NHS inform on 0800 22 44 88. </li>
			</ul>
			Pharmacists are experts about medicines, so any questions you have about your medicines and prescriptions can be answered by a pharmacist.
