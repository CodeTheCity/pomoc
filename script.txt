Healthcare is very different in the UK compared to Poland, here's what you need to know:

Have a cold, mild fever, minor aches and pains, or maybe some skin complaints? Your local pharmasist can sell you some remedies for this over the counter without a perscription and give you free advice on your condition.

If you find that your condition requires you to attend your doctor's surgery, the receptionist may ask you some questions about your condition. This is to direct you to the most appropriate person for your condition. This may not be a doctor, but may in stead be a nurse-practitioner, a practice nurse, or other health professional; this is to ensure that everyone can get an appointment suitable to their condition.
